				<h3 id='ACADEMIC'>Academic History and Goals:</h3>
				<p class='indent2'>I entered Indian River State College in the Fall semester of 2011. I'm currently working towards an A.S. in Computer Information Technology with a focus on Computer Programming. After I get my A.S. I hope to enter the workforce and continue my education. My eventual goal is to earn a B.S. And some more text. And some more text. And some more text. And some more text. And some more text. And some more text. And some more text. And some more text.

				<h3 id='PERSONAL'>Personal Interests:</h3>
				<p class='indent2'>As a Canadian, I have grown up with a love for winter sports, so it is a little unfortunate that I now live in a tropical climate. Starting from the age of eight, I would often go skiing with my family and friends. Most of the mountains I've skied are located in Canada and not very well known, but I have also had a chance to ski in Nagano, Japan. Another winter sport that I enjoy is Hockey, but I have never actually played it. I just enjoy watching it. In that regard, Florida is surprisingly well represented. And some more text.
