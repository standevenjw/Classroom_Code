			<h1 class='top'>Canada's Game</h1>
			<p class='top'>The sport of Ice Hockey has a large following in Canada. The popularity of the sport is extensive, but despite its popularity it was not until 1994 that it was recognized as a <a href='http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-16.7/FullText.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>national sport.</a> One way to demonstrate how much Canadians love hockey is by looking at the <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/home.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>International Ice Hockey Federation's website</a>. According to the IIHF, 572 411 <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>Canadians</a> play hockey at the amateur or professional level. The nation with the second highest total, the <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>United States</a>, has 500 579 registered hockey players. Those numbers are not very impressive <em>until</em> you remember that Canada has a national population of about 1/10 that of the United States. Other countries that are well-known for hockey, such as <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/russia.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>Russia</a>, <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>Sweden</a>, <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>Finland</a> and the <a href='http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/czech-republic.html' onclick='window.open(this.href); return false;'>Czech Republic</a>, have much lower totals. The sport is most popular in Canada for two main reasons. Firstly, Canada is the birthplace of Ice Hockey. While the exact origin and history is not clear, the most likely theory is that Scandinavian, British, and other European immigrants combined their traditional games with Native Canadian games and adapted them for an ice covered surface.</p>
			<p class='bottom'>Which brings us to the other reason for its popularity; most of Canada has a long, cold winter. In the technological world of today, ice rinks and NHL teams can be found in unlikely places such as Florida, Arizona and California. But back in the late 19th century and early 20th century, cold weather was an essential ingredient for the development and enjoyment of ice hockey. And cold weather still has its advantages today. It allows cities and parents to provide cheap ice surfaces in the form of outdoor rinks and backyard rinks. This contributes to the popularity of the sport by allowing Canadians, especially young Canadians, to play and develop a love for the game at little or no cost.</p>
